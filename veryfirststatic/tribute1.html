      <h2>Who was Stephen Hawking?</h2>
      <p class="tab1">Stephen Hawking (January 8, 1942 to March 14, 2018) was a British scientist, professor and author who performed groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and whose books helped to make science accessible to everyone. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.</p>

      <h2>Brief Timeline:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>1942</b> Born in Oxford, England (300 years after the death of Galileo).</li>
        <li><b>1953</b> Atends St Albans school in North London, where he develops a passion for mathematics. His father wants him to study medicine.</li>
        <li><b>1959</b> Specialises in physics at University Colleger Oxford. Graduates with a first class degree in natural sciences.</li>
        <li><b>1963</b> Begins research in cosmology and general relativity at the University of Cambridge. He is diagnosed with an "incurable disease" at the age of 21, which is later found to be Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a rare progressive disease that effects movement and speech.</li>
        <li><b>1966</b> Completes his doctorate and is awarded a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He works on singularities in the theory of general relativity and applies his ideas to the study of black holes. Collaborates with mathematician Roger Penrose, who was working at Birkbeck College in London.</li>
        <li><b>1970</b> Discovers a remarkable property: by using quantum theory and general relativity he is able to show that black holes can emit radiation.</li>
        <li><b>1973</b> Joins the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics at Cambridge. In the same year he discovers, to his disbelief, that black holes could leak energy and particles into space, and even explode in a fountain of high-energy sparks.</li>
        <li><b>1974</b> His breakthrough discovery is published in the journal Nature, in a paper entitled Black hole Explosion?</li>
        <li><b>1977</b> Appointed professor of gravitational physics at Cambridge.
  </li>
        <li><b>1982</b> Awarded a CBE by the Queen.
  </li>
        <li><b>1988</b> Publishes A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes, a classic introduction to today's most important scientific ideas about the cosmos. Recorded in the 1998 Guinness Book of Records as an all-time bestseller.</li>
        <li><b>1993</b> Publishes Black Holes and Baby Universes, and other Essays, a collection of scientific articles exploring ways in which the universe may be governed.</li>
        <li><b>1998</b> Publishes Stephen Hawking's Universe: The Cosmos Explained, a book about the basis of our existence and of everything around us.</li>
        <li><b>2002</b> Releases On the Shoulders of Giants, The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy, an exploration of some of the greatest visionaries in the history of science. He also publishes The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe, a book that presents the most complex theories of physics past and present. </li>
        <li><b>2004</b> Hawking announces that he has solved the Black Hole paradox, which has been a troubling scientists for years. He presents his most recent findings at the international conference on general relativity and gravitation in Dublin.</li>
        <li><b>2007</b> Hawking becomes the first quadriplegic to aboard a zero gravity flight. He experiences weightlessness eight time and performs some acrobatic maneuvers.</li>
        <li><b>2010</b> Hawking publishes The Grand Design, arguing against the idea that God created the universe.</li>
        <li><b>2014</b> A film about the life of Hawking and Jane Wilde is released, staring Eddie Redmayne as Hawking.</li>
        <li><b>2018</b> Hawking's family confirmed he had died peacefully.</li>
